# Comp-AI-Text-Vision

Availability of digital data in increasingly larger volumes, both as text and images, has enabled machine learning to provide effective solutions to applications that require intelligent processing of text and images. This unit explores the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques, in particular deep learning techniques, for tasks related to the processing of text and computer vision. Application areas include text search, sentiment analysis, information extraction, and image recognition.
